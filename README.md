# Car-Breakdown-Prediction
Predicitive maintainance - Finding remaining useful life (RUL) of a Car

Dataset: Car engine parameter (reading from 21 senors), operational settings modes (3-modes)

Steps I have performed:
- Data pre-processing
- Generating lables from time series data
- Machine Learning model development
- Error analysis

Machine Learning models that I tried and tested on given data:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Mahcine
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest

Error analysis: 
- Mean Squarred Error
- Mean Absolute Error
- R Squarred
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC Curve (Receiver operating characteristic).
